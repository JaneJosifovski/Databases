This is a database of all known alcohol producers in the Republic of Macedonia, including wineries, breweries, distilleries, individual farmers producing alcohol and other.
Iinformation details included about the producers are phone number(s), location(s), owner/contact name, business name, main products, social media and website, as well as other good-to-know information that could be used for all sorts of analysis or simply helping us have more complete rows.
The database is intentionally made in mainly Macedonian with small amounts of English wording, to make it way more accessible and useful to businesses and individuals that are interested in it, since its for a market that is small, very specific and not well known. But as well, I feel obligated under my principals to nurture my native language and culture, but providing material that is related to them in their proper language and to show my respect and regards to the Macedonian language.
