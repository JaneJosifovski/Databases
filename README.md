With this repositorium I try to show my work and progress in working with databases, and their optimal utilization.
Some DB tech used and seen in this repo are SQL-based databases (MySQL, PostgreSQL, SQLite, DBeaver, and etc.), but also trying my skills in DBs that are NOSQL or other type.
Most DBs are created and maintened by me locally, but some will be hosted soo and made avaiable in apps, but as of now they are just opensource for any GitHub user to use.
